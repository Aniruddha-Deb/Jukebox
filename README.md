# Jukebox
Android music player app with stunning visual effects

jukebox is <currently> a music player built for android with some very basic features such as ID3 tag data retrieval using 
the MediaMetadataRetriever class and support for formats such as .mp3, .wav and .flac via the MediaPlayer class. It is still 
a work in progress and is continuously being update by me. More changes, as and when they will be added, will be written down 
in this file
